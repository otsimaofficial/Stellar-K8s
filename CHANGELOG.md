✨ feat(security): Soroban reentrancy guard middleware
✨ feat(security): add Soroban reentrancy guard middleware
• Implements a native reentrancy guard sub-contract middleware under
• wasm-plugins/security/reentrancy/, enforced through the Stellar-K8s custom
• validation (Wasm) layer (issue #8).
• - Storage-agnostic write-lock stack core that reverts nested, mutating
•   cross-contract re-entries of the same state variable while producing zero
•   false positives on non-mutating read callbacks.
• - ConfigMap-driven per-namespace / per-contract-ID scoping with a safe
•   "enabled everywhere" default and explicit opt-outs.
• - Optional 'soroban' feature binds the core to Soroban host instance storage
•   and compiles to a no_std (alloc) wasm32-unknown-unknown guest that ships a
•   minimal global allocator; overhead stays < 500 instructions (MAX_DEPTH=8).
• - Deliberately vulnerable mock vault plus a 19-unit/7-integration security
•   suite proving the exploit and its prevention.
• - ADR 0005 documenting the locking mechanism, plus deployable ConfigMap
•   example.
